This is a list of software I use for my Research, or software I advise to my students. I only use Free Software. To know more about Free Software, consult [the FSF site](http://www.fsf.org/) and [the Wikipedia page about free software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

*    I use Kubuntu as the Operating System for my computer. It is free, fast, virus-free and very easy to use. It is part of the family of Linux operating systems, known for being robust and adapted for research work. Kubuntu is the combination of the Ubuntu OS and the KDE desktop environment.

*    For my statistical needs I use the R programming language. It is a very extensive and powerful programming language used worldwide by both researchers and firms and is rapidly taking the place of other statistical software packages like SAS. You can install it on Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions) via their respective package managers. For Windows and OSX versions, you can get R for free on the project's page.

*    R's interface is very basic, so I use and recommend Rstudio. It's a modern interface available for all platforms, and for free.

  <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">

</div>

*    LaTeX is used extensively in academia to write scientific papers. It takes care of the formatting for you, allowing you to focus on what really matters. Writing mathematical equations in LaTeX is also very easy and the result is beautiful. For Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions), installing LaTeX is done via the system's package manager (For Ubuntu, you can install the texlive-full package and have everything you need to begin using LaTeX). For Windows users, you'll need to install Miktex and for OSX MacTeX

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="http://dev.midnightcoding.org/projects/gummi">
    <img src="/assets/images/Gummi-logo.png" width="80" height="80"/></a>
</div>

*    To edit tex documents, you'll need an editor. I recommend Gummi, it's lightweight and has a very useful live-preview feature. It is only available for Linux distributions for now. Gummi is available on the repositories.

  <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">
    <img src="/assets/images/pandas_logo.png" width="300" height="80"/></a>
</div>

*    I use Pandas, a python library, when I need to manipulate data sets before using them. Pandas allows you to clean, merge and rotate your data sets, and much more.
