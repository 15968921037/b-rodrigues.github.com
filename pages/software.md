This is a list of software I use for my Research, or software I advise to my students. I only use Free Software. 
Free here is not about price, but about freedom. Think of free as in free speech. The reasons I chose to use free software are both 
practical and philosophical. Free software gives me infinite flexibility: I can install it on any machine I own without having to worry
about licenses or worry that the software may become deprecated some day. As for the philosophical reasons, I think that free software is in line
with the way science should be done: sharing knowledge, helping each other and disapprove of unethical behaviour.
To know more about Free Software, consult [the FSF site](http://www.fsf.org/) and [the Wikipedia page about free software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

*   I use openSUSE as my operating system. It's fast, stable, doesn't nag me with forced and unwanted 
updates and has a lot of software available for it in the default repositories.

*    For my statistical needs I use the R programming language. It is a very 
extensive and powerful programming language used worldwide by both researchers 
and firms and is rapidly taking the place of other statistical software programs like SAS. 
You can install it on any linux distribution via its package manager. For Windows and OSX versions, you can get R for 
free on the project's page. It works best if you also install Rstudio, which is a modern IDE for R.

*    I use the Python programming language when R isn't enough. To 
simplify the installation of the different Python libraries and have a 
consistent environment across my different computers (and coworkers' computers) 
I use Anaconda by Continuum Analytics. It is a free, commercially supported 
Python distribution and it works very well. It comes with everything you'd need 
from a Python distribution, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Pandas, one of the 
most useful Python libraries out there.


<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">

*    LaTeX is used extensively in academia to write scientific papers. 
It takes care of the formatting for you, allowing you to focus on what really 
matters. Writing mathematical equations in LaTeX is also very easy and the 
result is beautiful. On any GNU+Linux distribution, installing 
LaTeX is done via the system's package manager.
For Windows users, you'll need to install Miktex and for OSX MacTeX.

*   I've been using a bunch of different editors, one editor per language, but
now I've completely switched to just using Neovim to edit R files, Python files and
Latex files. There are a lot of very good IDEs out there (such as Rstudio for R),
but now that I'm really getting confortable with Vim, I prefer to just use Vim for 
everything. Neovim is a modern implementation of Vim, and works very well.

*   I'm not a designer by any means, but when I need to design a poster for a conference,
or a call for papers, I use Gimp and Scribus. Gimp is an image manipulation tool not unlike
Adobe Photoshop and Scribus is a desktop publishing tool like Adobe Indesign.
