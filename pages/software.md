This is a list of software I use for my Research, or software I advise to my students. I only use Free Software. To know more about Free Software, consult [the FSF site](http://www.fsf.org/) and [the Wikipedia page about free software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

*    I use openSUSE as the operating system for my computer. It is a very 
stable operating system, fast and virus-free. After having used Ubuntu (another 
linux distribution) for years, I came across openSUSE recently and decided to 
switch to it. For now, it's been a pleasant ride.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">
    <img src="/assets/images/Rlogo.jpg" width="80" height="80"/></a>
</div>

*    For my statistical needs I use the R programming language. It is a very 
extensive and powerful programming language used worldwide by both researchers 
and firms and is rapidly taking the place of other statistical software programs like SAS. 
You can install it on any linux distribution via its package manager. For Windows and OSX versions, you can get R for 
free on the project's page.

</div>

*    R's interface is very basic, so I use and recommend Rstudio. It's a modern 
interface available for all platforms, and for free.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">
    <img src="/assets/images/latex.png" width="160" height="80"/></a>
</div>

*    LaTeX is used extensively in academia to write scientific papers. 
It takes care of the formatting for you, allowing you to focus on what really 
matters. Writing mathematical equations in LaTeX is also very easy and the 
result is beautiful. For Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions), installing 
LaTeX is done via the system's package manager (For Ubuntu, you can install the 
texlive-full package and have everything you need to begin using LaTeX). For 
Windows users, you'll need to install Miktex and for OSX MacTeX

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="http://dev.midnightcoding.org/projects/gummi">
    <img src="/assets/images/Gummi-logo.png" width="80" height="80"/></a>
</div>

*    To edit tex documents, you'll need an editor. I recommend Gummi, it's 
lightweight and has a very useful live-preview feature. It is only available for 
Linux distributions for now. Gummi is available on the repositories. My editor 
of choice however is Kate with Vi input enabled. Vi is an old editor and is not 
recommended for beginners, but once mastered you'll never look back again.

</div>

*    Finally, I use the Python programming language when R isn't enough. To 
simplify the installation of the different Python libraries and have a 
consistent environment across my different computers (and coworkers' computers) 
I use Anaconda by Continuum Analytics. It is a free, commercially supported 
Python distribution and it works very well. It comes with everything you'd need 
from a Python distribution, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Pandas, one of the 
most useful Python libraries out there.
