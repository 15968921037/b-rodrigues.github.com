Gumbel Linux is a distribution I made using [Suse 
Studio](http://susestudio.com). It is thus based on OpenSuse 12.3 and comes 
pre-installed with everything an econometrician, statistician or anyone doing 
stats might need. This includes the R programming language with the Rstudio 
interface, the Octave programming language with the QtOctave interface, Gretl, 
GeoGebra, IPython with Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas... as well as TeX Live 
so you can start writing your papers immediately!

You can download it here: [direct 
download](http://susestudio.com/a/USzD7U/gumbel-linux) (requires 
Suse Studio account) and

##FAQ

###Do we really need another linux distribution?
I think that this distribution (or spin rather) is unique in the sense that it 
provides a complete and out of the box operating system useful for 
econometricians and statisticians. These users are scientists who want to get 
work done and not bother with technicalities about software installation.

###Why is it based on OpenSuse and not *insert favorite distro here*
I use OpenSuse daily, and it's very stable has a nice selection of software 
available in its repos and making spins of it is very easy thanks to [Suse 
studio](http://susestudio.com). 

###Which software is pre-installed with Gumbel Linux?
- Complete Python environment for scientific computing: IPython, Scipy, Numpy, 
Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Sympy...
- R and Rstudio
- Octave with QtOctave
- Gretl
- Libreoffice
- Complete Latex environment: a lot of useful packages are pre-installed, as 
well as Kile, a very powerful editor for .tex documents
- GeoGebra

And of course a lot of different software for daily tasks:
- Web browser: Firefox
- Music player: Clementine
- Video player: VLC
- E-mail client and organizer: Kontact
- Pdf reader, unarchiver, CD and DVD authoring tool, etc...

###Can I install Gumbel Linux on my computer?
Yes you can, simply select *Live Installer* from the menu:

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>


When prompted for a password, enter *password*. Please note that Gumbel Linux 
only works on 64 bits architectures.

###I'm happy with my current operating system. Why should I use this?
Well, it really depends on what your current operating system is. If it's 
Microsoft Windows or Apple's OSX, I suggest that you change to a Linux-based 
distribution, since Windows and OSX are not Free Software. Note that Free here 
is not about price, but about freedom. Proprietary operating systems like 
Windows or OSX [trap 
their users](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in#Microsoft). So if you 
want to switch to a Linux distribution which comes preloaded with software you 
need, why not try Gumbel Linux?

If your current operating system is a Linux distribution or a BSD operating 
system, I suggest that you keep using it, but if you are using proprietary 
software on them, consider switching to Free (as in freedom) alternatives.

Open source software.

sorry) explains how Free and Open Source statistical software is more reliably 
than proprietary alternatives.

Of course, Gumbel Linux (as is OpenSuse) is not entirely composed of strictly, 
completely Free Software, but comes with so-called binary blobs which are 
actually drivers to make it work on as many computers as possible. Only a 
handful of Linux distributions are recommended by the Free Software Foundation. 

###What is "Gumbel"?

Let's quote Wikipedia:

>Emil Julius Gumbel (18 July 1891, Munich â€“ 10 September 1966, New York City) 
>was a German mathematician and political writer.

>Born in Munich, he graduated from the University of Munich shortly before the 
>outbreak of the First World War. He was Professor of Mathematical Statistics 
>at the University of Heidelberg.

>As a mathematician, Gumbel was instrumental in the development of extreme value 
>theory, along with Leonard Tippett and Ronald Fisher. In 1958, Gumbel 
>published a key book on the topic: Statistics of Extremes. He derived and 
>analyzed the probability distribution that is now known as the Gumbel 
>distribution in his honor.
