Here's a short description:

>The Great Moderation was a phenomenon characterized by great economic stability in all OECD countries. In my Masterâ€™s thesis, I study this phenomenon in the Euro Area using a medium-scale, Markov-switching DSGE model and find that the Great Moderation in the Euro Area was due to better policy by the monetary authorities

Now, I'm working on dynamic models, where the utility of an agent not only depends on his decisions today, but also on decisions he'll make tomorrow. A basic example is the famous cake eating problem, where an agent receives a cake and has to decide on when to eat it. Should the agent eat everything today, leave some for tomorrow, or eat it whole tomorrow? There exist a lot of methods to estimate such models, and I started looking into simulated maximum likelihood estimators. [Here](simulated_max_lik.html) you'll find an example taken from Cameron and Trivedi's book - Microeconometrics Methods and Applications, where the authors maximize a simulated log likelihood. I attempted to translate the code to R.

I also translated the code from the Method of Simulated Moments that is just a few pages further in the book into R. The model is strictly the same, but the parameter is estimated using MSM. You can read about it [here.](simulated_moments.html)
