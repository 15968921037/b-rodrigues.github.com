[Version Control Systems to Facilitate Research Collaboration in Economics](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10614-015-9513-8), in Computational Economics, 2015

Abstract
--------


Reliable and reproducible research is an important cornerstone of science, and version control systems not only make reproducible research possible in a rapid and easy way, but also provide a way of collaborating with co-authors. 
The purpose of this methodological paper is to present Git, a very successful version control system and how it can be used by economists working together on their papers and the accompanying computer code. 
Version control systems also make sharing the findings with the rest of the scientific community more easy and streamlined. 
To understand how version control systems came to be, one must be familiar with the history of free software. 
In the introduction, I will present free software and its philosophy and show how version control systems make free software possible. 
In the second section I present Git which is a widely used version control system. In the third section I show a basic usage of Git. In the fourth section, I conclude.

The birth of a child and its impact on wages and worked hours: evidence from France, 2015-2016, with Vincent Vergnat

Abstract
--------

Using French administrative data, we estimate the impact of the birth of a first child on hourly and daily wages, as well as for hours worked, for both women and men. 
We compute the impact on these outcome variables, two, four and eight years after the birth of the child, using difference-in-differences.
We compare the impact for different education levels of both mothers and fathers. The results show that in the short term there is no impact of a birth on wages and hours worked but eight years after
the birth of a child, highly educated women suffer from a loss in daily and hourly wages as well as hours worked. 
Educated men also decrease their labour supply.

Master's Thesis
===============

You can download my Master's Thesis [here.](http://min.us/l5AzLDg7Tyu58)  

Here's a short description:

>The Great Moderation was a phenomenon characterized by great economic stability in all OECD countries. In my Master’s thesis, I study this phenomenon in the Euro Area using a medium-scale, Markov-switching DSGE model and find that the Great Moderation in the Euro Area was due to better policy by the monetary authorities.

I'm currently working on two papers in collaboration with people from the ZEW (Raphael Abiry, François Laisney, Holger Stichnoth), University of Bonn (Hans-Martin von Gaudecker) and the IFS (Richard Blundell) on fertility and labor supply of highly educated women in Germany and France (the first project is financed by the SEEK and the other by the ANR-DFG). We estimate a dynamic discrete choice model with human capital accumulation and skills transferability between jobs. Links to the papers will be posted when they're done.

With my thesis advisor, Betrand Kœbel, we are currently working on a paper where we explain how an employer, (which can decide to delegate the wage fixing decision to an employee), and his employee can cooperate and attain higher pay-offs despite having conflicting objectives. For this, we estimate a dynamic model with GMM using data from Charness (2012).
