Here's a short description:

>The Great Moderation was a phenomenon characterized by great economic stability in all OECD countries. In my Master’s thesis, I study this phenomenon in the Euro Area using a medium-scale, Markov-switching DSGE model and find that the Great Moderation in the Euro Area was due to better policy by the monetary authorities.

I'm currently working on two papers in collaboration with people from the ZEW (Raphael Abiry, François Laisney, Holger Stichnoth), University of Bonn (Hans-Martin von Gaudecker) and the IFS (Richard Blundell) on fertility and labor supply of highly educated women in Germany and France (both projects funded by the DFG - ANR). We estimate a dynamic discrete choice model with human capital accumulation and skills transferability between jobs. Links to the papers will be posted when they're done.

With my thesis advisor, Betrand Kœbel, we are currently working on a paper where we explain how an employer, (which can decide to delegate the wage fixing decision to an employee), and his employee can cooperate and attain higher pay-offs despite having conflicting objectives. For this, we estimate a dynamic model with GMM using data from Charness (2012).

Finally, here is a short paper I wrote on reproducibility in econometrics, and how reproducibility is made easier with Git. This paper will probably not be part of my thesis, because it is more a by-product of working with colleagues that are physically hundreds of kilometers away from me. This is still a draft, and may remain like this forever, but in case someone finds it interesting, here it is: [link.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8qooxct1wgdkv1w/Version%20control%20systems%20to%20facilitate%20research%20collaboration%20in%20economics%20-%20Bruno%20Rodrigues.pdf?dl=0)
