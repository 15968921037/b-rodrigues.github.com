Hi! My name is Bruno Rodrigues, and I'm a research assistant at the research division of [STATEC](http://www.statistiques.public.lu/en/actors/statec/organisation/red/index.html).

I program mostly in R and love sharing my knowledge, that's why I started this blog.
I share my posts also on [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com). In my posts, I discuss
new packages I discovered or new ways of using packages.

If you were one of my students, and need some of the materials I taught, just drop me an [email](mailto:bruno@brodrigues.co).

You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/brodriguesco) for blog updates.

I'm writing a book as a hobby about functional programming, unit testing and package
development with R. You can read it for [free](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/).

You can also download my package, called [brotools](https://bitbucket.org/b-rodrigues/brotools),
which contains some functions I use daily. You might find them useful too!
