There's a lot going on in the development version of `{tidyr}`. New functions for pivoting data
frames, `pivot_wide()` and `pivot_long()` are coming, and will replace the current functions,
`spread()` and `gather()`. `spread()` and `gather()` will remain in the package though:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1108107722128613377")
```

If you want to try out these new functions, you need to install the development version of `{tidyr}`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
```

and you can read the vignette [here](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html#many-variables-in-column-names).
Because these functions are still being developed, some more changes might be introduced, but I guess
that the main functionality will not change much.

Let's play around with these functions and the `mtcars` data set. First let's load the packages and
the data:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(mtcars)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(mtcars)
```

First, let's create a wide dataset, by *spreading* the levels of the "am" column to two new columns:

```{r}
mtcars_wide1 <- mtcars %>% 
    pivot_wide(names_from = "am", values_from = "mpg") 

mtcars_wide1 %>% 
    select(`0`, `1`, everything())
```

`pivot_wide()`'s arguments are quite explicit: `names_from = ` is where you specify the column that
will be spread across the data frame, meaning, the levels of this column will become new columns.
`values_from = ` is where you specify the column that will fill in the values of the new columns.

"0" and "1" are the new columns ("am" had two levels, `0` and `1`), which contain the miles per 
gallon for manual and automatic cars respectively. Let's also take a look at the data frame itself:

```{r}
mtcars_wide1 %>% 
    select(`0`, `1`, everything())
```

Now suppose that we want to spread the values of "am" times "cyl", and filling the data with the 
values of "mpg":

```{r}
mtcars_wide2 <- mtcars %>% 
    pivot_wide(names_from = c("am", "cyl"), values_from = "mpg") 

mtcars_wide2 %>% 
    select(matches("^0|1"), everything())
```

As you can see, this is easily achieved by simply providing more columns to `names_from = `.

Finally, it is also possible to use an optional data set which contains the specifications of the 
new columns:

```{r}
mtcars_spec <- mtcars %>% 
    expand(am, cyl, .value = "mpg") %>%
    unite(".name", am, cyl, remove = FALSE)

mtcars_spec
```

This optional data set defines how the columns "0_4", "0_6" etc are constructed, and also the 
value that shall be used to fill in the values. "am" and "cyl" will be used to create the ".name"
and the "mpg" column will be used for the ".value":

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    pivot_wide(spec = mtcars_spec) %>% 
    select(matches("^0|1"), everything())
```

Using a spec is especially useful if you need to make new levels that are not in the data.
For instance, suppose that there are actually 10-cylinder cars too, but they do not appear in our
sample. We would like to make the fact that they're missing explicit:

```{r}
mtcars_spec2 <- mtcars %>% 
    expand(am, "cyl" = c(cyl, 10), .value = "mpg") %>%
    unite(".name", am, cyl, remove = FALSE)

mtcars_spec2
```


```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    pivot_wide(spec = mtcars_spec2) %>% 
    select(matches("^0|1"), everything())
```

As you can see, we now have two more columns have been added, and they are full of NA's.

Now, let's try to go from wide to long data sets, using `pivot_long()`:

```{r}
mtcars_wide1 %>% 
  pivot_long(cols = c(`1`, `0`), names_to = "am", values_to = "mpg") %>% 
  select(am, mpg, everything())
```

The arguments of `pivot_long()` are quite explicit too, and similar to the ones in `pivot_wide()`.
`cols = ` is where the user specifies the columns that need to be pivoted. `names_to = ` is where
the user can specify the name of the new columns, whose levels will be exactly the ones specified
to `cols = `. `values_to = ` is where the user specifies the column name of the new column that
will contain the values. 

It is also possible to specify the columns that should not be transformed, by using `-`:

```{r}
mtcars_wide1 %>% 
  pivot_long(cols = -matches("^[[:alpha:]]"), names_to = "am", values_to = "mpg") %>% 
  select(am, mpg, everything())
```

Here the columns that should not be modified are all those that start with a letter, hence the "^[[:alpha:]]"
regular expression. It is also possible to remove all the `NA`'s from the data frame, with `na.rm = `.

```{r}
mtcars_wide1 %>% 
  pivot_long(cols = c(`1`, `0`), names_to = "am", values_to = "mpg", na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  select(am, mpg, everything())
```

We can also pivot data frames where the names of the columns are made of two or more variables,
for example in our `mtcars_wide2` data frame:

```{r}
mtcars_wide2 %>% 
    select(matches("^0|1"), everything())
```

All the columns that start with either "0" or "1" must be pivoted:

```{r}
mtcars_wide2 %>% 
  pivot_long(cols = matches("0|1"), names_to = "am_cyl", values_to = "mpg", na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  select(am_cyl, everything())
```

Now, there is one new column, "am_cyl" which must still be transformed by separating "am_cyl" into two new columns:


```{r}
mtcars_wide2 %>% 
  pivot_long(cols = matches("0|1"), names_to = "am_cyl", values_to = "mpg", na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  separate(am_cyl, into = c("am", "cyl"), sep = "_") %>% 
  select(am, cyl, everything())
```

It is also possible to achieve this using a data frame with the specification of what you need:

```{r}
mtcars_spec_long <- mtcars_wide2 %>% 
  pivot_long_spec(matches("0|1"), values_to = "mpg") %>% 
  separate(name, c("am", "cyl"), sep = "_")

mtcars_spec_long
```

Providing this spec to `pivot_long()` solves the issue:

```{r}
mtcars_wide2 %>% 
  pivot_long(spec = mtcars_spec_long, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  select(am, cyl, everything())
```
