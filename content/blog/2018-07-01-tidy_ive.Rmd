In this blog post I will discuss missing data imputation and instrumental variables regression. This
is based on a short presentation I will give at my job. You can find the data used here on this 
website: http://eclr.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/IV_in_R

The data is used is from Wooldridge's book, *Econometrics: A modern Approach*.
You can download the data by clicking [here](http://eclr.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/images/5/5f/Mroz.csv). 

This is the variable description:

```
 1. inlf                     =1 if in labor force, 1975
 2. hours                    hours worked, 1975
 3. kidslt6                  # kids < 6 years
 4. kidsge6                  # kids 6-18
 5. age                      woman's age in yrs
 6. educ                     years of schooling
 7. wage                     estimated wage from earns., hours
 8. repwage                  reported wage at interview in 1976
 9. hushrs                   hours worked by husband, 1975
10. husage                   husband's age
11. huseduc                  husband's years of schooling
12. huswage                  husband's hourly wage, 1975
13. faminc                   family income, 1975
14. mtr                      fed. marginal tax rate facing woman
15. motheduc                 mother's years of schooling
16. fatheduc                 father's years of schooling
17. unem                     unem. rate in county of resid.
18. city                     =1 if live in SMSA
19. exper                    actual labor mkt exper
20. nwifeinc                 (faminc - wage*hours)/1000
21. lwage                    log(wage)
22. expersq                  exper^2
```

The goal is to first impute missing data in the data set, and then determine the impact of one added
year of education on wages. If one simply ignores missing values, bias can be introduced depending on 
the missingness mechanism. The second problem here is that education is likely to be endogeneous
(and thus be correlated to the error term), as it is not randomly assigned. This causes biased estimates
and may lead to seriously wrong conclusions. So missingness and endogeneity should be dealt with, but
dealing with both issues is more of a programming challenge than an econometrics challenge. 
Thankfully, the packages contained in the `{tidyverse}` as well as `{mice}` will save the day!

If you inspect the data, you will see that there are no missing values. So I will use the `{mice}` 
package to first *ampute* the data (which means adding missing values). This, of course, is done
for education purposes. If you're lucky enough to not have missing values in your data, you shouldn't 
add them!

Let's load all the packages needed:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(AER)
library(naniar)
library(mice)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(AER)
library(naniar)
library(mice)
```

So first, let's read in the data, and ampute it:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
wages_data <- read_csv("http://eclr.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/images/5/5f/Mroz.csv")
```

First, I only select the variables I want to use and convert them to the correct class:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
wages_data <- wages_data %>% 
    select(wage, educ, fatheduc, motheduc, inlf, hours, 
               kidslt6, kidsge6, age, huswage, 
               mtr, unem, city, exper) %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(kidslt6, kidsge6, hours, educ, age, wage, huswage, mtr,
                    motheduc, fatheduc, unem, exper), as.numeric) %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(city, inlf), as.character)
```

In the data, some women are not in the labour force, and thus do not have any wages; meaning they
should have a 0 there. Instead, this is represented with the following symbol: ".". So I convert 
these dots to 0. One could argue that the wages should not be 0, but that they're truly missing.
This is true, and there are ways to deal with such questions (Heckman's selection model for instance),
but this is not the point here.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
wages_data <- wages_data %>% 
    mutate(wage = ifelse(is.na(wage), 0, wage))
```

Let's double check if there are any missing values in the data, using `naniar::vis_miss()`:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
vis_miss(wages_data)
```

Nope! Let's ampute it:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
wages_mis <- ampute(wages_data)$amp
```

`ampute()` returns an object where the `amp` element is the amputed data. This is what I save into 
the new variable `wages_mis`.

Let's take a look:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
vis_miss(wages_mis)
```

Ok, so now we have missing values. Let's use the recently added `mice::parlmice()` function to 
impute the dataset, in parallel:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
imp_wages <- parlmice(data = wages_mis, m = 10, maxit = 20, cl.type = "FORK")
```

For reproducibility, I save these objects to disk:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
write_csv(wages_mis, "wages_mis.csv")

saveRDS(imp_wages, "imp_wages.rds")
```

As a sanity check, let's look at the missingness pattern for the first completed dataset:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
vis_miss(complete(imp_wages))
```

`mice::parlmice()` was able to impute the dataset. I imputed it 10 times, so now I have 10 imputed 
datasets. If I want to estimate a model using this data, I will need to do so 10 times.
This is where the tidyverse comes into play. First, let's combine all the 10 imputed datasets into
one long dataset, with an index to differentiate them. This is done easily with `mice::complete()`:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
imp_wages_df <- mice::complete(imp_wages, "long")
```

Let's take a look at the data:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
head(imp_wages_df)
```

As you can see, there are two new columns, `.id` and `.imp`. `.imp` equals `i` means that it is the
`i`th imputed dataset.

Because I have 0's in my dependent variable, I will not log the wages but instead use the Inverse
Hyperbolic Sine transformation. Marc F. Bellemare wrote a nice post about
it [here](http://marcfbellemare.com/wordpress/12856).

```{r, cache=TRUE}
ihs <- function(x){
    log(x + sqrt(x**2 + 1))
}
```

I can now apply this function, but first I have to group by `.imp`. Remember, these are 10 separated
datasets. I also create the experience squared:

```{r}
imp_wages_df <- imp_wages_df %>% 
    group_by(.imp) %>% 
    mutate(ihs_wage = ihs(wage),
           exper2 = exper**2)
```

Now comes some tidyverse magic. I will create a new dataset by using the `nest()` function from `tidyr`. 

```{r}
(imp_wages <- imp_wages_df %>% 
    group_by(.imp) %>% 
    nest())
```

As you can see, `imp_wages` is now a dataset with two columns: `.imp`, indexing the imputed datasets,
and a column called `data`, where each element is itself a tibble! `data` is a so-called list-column.
You can read more about it on the
[`purrr` tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls13_list-columns.html) written by 
[Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan).

Estimating a model now is easy, if you're familiar with `purrr`. This is how you do it:

```{r}
imp_wages_reg = imp_wages %>% 
    mutate(lin_reg = map(data, 
                         ~lm(ihs_wage ~ educ + inlf + hours + 
                                 kidslt6 + kidsge6 + age + huswage + 
                                 mtr + unem + city + exper + exper2, 
                             data = .)))
```

Ok, so what happened here? `imp_wages` is a data frame, so it's possible to add a column to it
with `mutate()`. I call that column `lin_reg` and use `map()` on the column called `data` (remember, 
this column is actually a list of data frame objects, and `map()` takes a list as an argument, and then a 
function or formula) with the following formula:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
~lm(ihs_wage ~ educ + inlf + hours + 
        kidslt6 + kidsge6 + age + huswage + 
        mtr + unem + city + exper + exper2, 
    data = .)
```

This formula is nothing more that a good old linear regression. The last line `data = .` means that
the data to be used inside `lm()` should be coming from the list called `data`, which is the second
column of `imp_wages`. As I'm writing these lines, I realize it is confusing as hell. But I promise 
you that learning to use `purrr` is a bit like learning how to use a bicycle. Very difficult to explain,
but once you know how to do it, it feels super natural. Take some time to play with the lines above 
to really understand what happened. 

Now, let's take a look at the result:

```{r}
imp_wages_reg
```

`imp_wages_reg` now has a third column called `lin_reg` where each element is a linear model, estimated
on the data from the `data` column! We can now pool the results of these 10 regressions using 
`mice::pool()`:

```{r}
pool_lin_reg <- pool(imp_wages_reg$lin_reg)

summary(pool_lin_reg)
```

This function averages the results from the 10 regressions and computes correct standard errors. This
is based on Rubin's rules (Rubin, 1987, p. 76). As you can see, the linear regression indicates that
one year of added education has a positive, significant effect of log wages (they're not log wages,
I used the IHS transformation, but *log wages* just sounds better than *inverted hyperbolic sined wages*).
This effect is almost 4%. 

But education is not randomly assigned, and as such might be endogenous. This is where instrumental
variables come into play. An instrument is a variables that impacts the dependent variable only through
the endogenous variable (here, education). For example, the education of the parents do not have 
a direct impact over one's wage, but having college-educated parents means that you are likely 
college-educated yourself, and thus have a higher wage that if you only have a high school diploma.

I am thus going to instrument education with both parents' education:

```{r}
imp_wages_reg = imp_wages_reg %>% 
    mutate(iv_reg = map(data, 
                         ~ivreg(ihs_wage ~ educ + inlf + hours + 
                                 kidslt6 + kidsge6 + age + huswage + 
                                 mtr + unem + city + exper + exper2 |.-educ + fatheduc + motheduc, 
                             data = .)))
```

The only difference from before is the formula:

```{r}
~ivreg(ihs_wage ~ educ + inlf + hours + 
           kidslt6 + kidsge6 + age + huswage + 
           mtr + unem + city + exper + exper2 |.-educ + fatheduc + motheduc, 
       data = .)
```

Instead of `lm()` I use `AER::ivreg()` and the formula has a second part, after the `|` symbol. This
is where I specify that I instrument education with the parents' education. 

`imp_wages_reg` now looks like this:

```{r}
imp_wages_reg
```

Let's take a look at the results:

```{r}
pool_iv_reg <- pool(imp_wages_reg$iv_reg)

summary(pool_iv_reg)
```

As you can see, education is not statistically significant anymore! This is why it is quite important
to think about endogeneity issues. However, it is not always very easy to find suitable instruments.
A series of tests exist to determine if you have relevant and strong instruments, but this blog post
is already long enough. I will leave this for a future blog post.
