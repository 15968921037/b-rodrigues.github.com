I won't write a very long introduction; we all know that Excel is ubiquitous in business, and that
it has a lot of very nice features, especially for business practitioners that do not know any 
programming. However, when people use Excel for purposes it was not designed for, it can be a 
hassle. Often, people use Excel as a reporting tool, which it is not; they create very elaborated
and complicated spreadsheets that are human readable, but impossible to import within any other tool.

In this blog post (which will probably be part of a series), I show you how you can go from this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/time_use.png")
```

to this:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/time_use2.png")
```

You can find the data I will use [here](http://statistiques.public.lu/stat/ReportFolders/ReportFolder.aspx?IF_Language=eng&MainTheme=3&FldrName=1&RFPath=14306). Click on the "Time use" folder and you can download the workbook.

The Excel workbook contains several sheets (in French and English) of the amount of time Luxembourguish
citizens spend from Monday to Sunday. For example, on average, people that are in employment spend
almost 8 hours sleeping during the week days, and 8:45 hours on Saturday.

As you can see from the screenshot, each sheet contains several tables that have lots of headers
and these tables are next to one another. Trying to import these sheets with good ol' `readxl::read_excel()`
produces a monster.

This is where `{tidyxl}` comes into play. Let's import the workbook with `{tidyxl}`:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyxl)

time_use_xl <- xlsx_cells("time-use.xlsx")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyxl)

time_use_xl <- xlsx_cells("time-use.xlsx")
```

Let's see what happened:

```{r}
head(time_use_xl)
```

As you can see, the sheet was imported, but the result might be unexpected. Actually, `time_use_xl`
is a `tibble` object, where each row is one cell of the Excel sheet. This might seem very complicated
to handle, but you will see that it actually makes things way easier.

I only want to work on the English sheets so I use the following code to ignore the French ones:

```{r}
sheets <- xlsx_sheet_names("time-use.xlsx") %>%
    keep(grepl(pattern = ".*day$", .))
```

Also, there's a sheet that aggregates the results for week days and weekends, which I also ignore.

Now, to extract the tables from each sheet I wrote the following function:

```{r}
extract_data <- function(sheet){
    activities <- sheet %>%
        filter(col == 2) %>%
        select(row, character) %>%
        filter(row %in% seq(6,58)) %>%
        rename(activities = character) %>%
        select(-row)
    
    cols_to_extract <- sheet %>% 
        filter(grepl("Population who completed.*", character)) %>% 
        pull(col)
    
    headers_pos <- cols_to_extract - 1
    
    headers <- sheet %>%
        filter(col %in% headers_pos, row == 3) %>%
        pull(character)
    
    cols_to_extract %>% 
        map(~filter(sheet, col %in% .)) %>%
        map(~select(., sheet, address, row, col, character)) %>%
        map(~filter(., row %in% seq(6,58))) %>%
        map(~select(., character)) %>%
        map2(.x = ., .y = headers, ~mutate(.x, "population" = .y)) %>%
        map(., ~bind_cols(activities, .)) %>%
        bind_rows()
}
```

Let's study it step by step and see how it works. First, there's the argument, `sheet`. This function
will be mapped to each sheet of the workbook. Then, the first block I wrote, extracts the 
activities:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    activities <- sheet %>%
        filter(col == 2) %>%
        select(row, character) %>%
        filter(row %in% seq(6,58)) %>%
        rename(activities = character) %>%
        select(-row)
```

I only keep the second column (`filter(col == 2)`); `col` is a column of the `tibble` and if you
look inside the workbook, you will notice that the activities are on the second column, or the B
column. Then, I select two columns, the `row` and the `character` column. `row` is self-explanatory
and `character` actually contains whatever is written inside the cells. Then, I only keep rows
6 to 58, because that is what interests me; the rest is either empty cells, or unneeded. Finally,
I rename the `character` column to activities and remove the `row` column.

The second block:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    cols_to_extract <- sheet %>% 
        filter(grepl("Population who completed.*", character)) %>% 
        pull(col)
```

returns the index of the columns I want to extract. I am only interested in the people that have
completed the activities, so using `grepl()` inside `filter()`, I located these columns, and use
`pull()`... to pull them out of the data frame! `cols_to_extract` is thus a nice atomic vector of 
columns that I want to keep.

In the third block, I extract the headers: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    headers_pos <- cols_to_extract - 1
```

Why `- 1`? This is because if you look in the Excel, you will see that the headers are one column before
the column labeled "People who completed the activity". For example on column G, I have "People who completed the activity"
and on column F I have the header, in this case "Male".

Now I actually extract the headers:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    headers <- sheet %>%
        filter(col %in% headers_pos, row == 3) %>%
        pull(character)
```

Headers are always on the third row, but on different columns, hence the `col %in% headers_pos`. I
then pull out the values inside the cells with `pull(character)`. So my `headers` object will be 
an atomic vector with "All", "Male", "Female", "10 - 19 years", etc... everything on row 3.

Finally, the last block, actually extracts the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    cols_to_extract %>% 
        map(~filter(sheet, col %in% .)) %>%
        map(~select(., sheet, address, row, col, character)) %>%
        map(~filter(., row %in% seq(6,58))) %>%
        map(~select(., character)) %>%
        map2(.x = ., .y = headers, ~mutate(.x, "population" = .y)) %>%
        map(., ~bind_cols(activities, .)) %>%
        bind_rows()
```

`cols_to_extract` is a vector with the positions of the columns that interest me. So for example
"4", "7", "10" and so on. I map this vector to the sheet, which returns me a list of extracted 
data frames. I pass this down to a `select()` (which is inside `map()`... why? Because the input
parameter is a list of data frames). So for each data frame inside the list, I select the columns
`sheet`, `address`, `row`, `col` and `character`. Then, for each data frame inside the list,
I use `filter()` to only keep the rows from position 6 to 58. Then, I only select the `character`
column, which actually contains the text inside the cell. Then, using `map2()`, I add the values
inside the `headers` object as a new column, called `population`. Then, I bind the `activities`
column to the data frame and bind all the rows together.

Time to use this function! Let's see:

```{r}
clean_data <- sheets %>%
    map(~filter(time_use_xl, sheet %in% .)) %>%
    set_names(sheets) %>%
    map(extract_data) %>%
    map2(.x = ., .y = sheets, ~mutate(.x, "day" = .y)) %>%
    bind_rows() %>%
    select(day, population, activities, time = character)

glimpse(clean_data)

```

So I map my list of sheets to the `tibble` I imported with `readxl`, use `set_names` to 
name the elements of my list (which is superfluous, but I wanted to show this; might interest you!)
and then map this result to my little function. I could stop here,
but I then add a new column to each data frame that contains the day on which the data was 
measured, bind the rows together and reorder the columns. Done!

Now, how did I come up with this function? I did not start with a function. I started by writing
some code that did what I wanted for one table only, inside one sheet only. Only when I got 
something that worked, did I start to generalize to several tables and then to several sheets. Most
of the time spent was actually in trying to find patterns in the Excel sheet that I could use 
to write my function (for example noticing that the headers I wanted where always one column before
the column I was interested in). This is my advice when working with function programming; always
solve the issue for one element, wrap this code inside a function, and then simply map this function
to a list of elements!
