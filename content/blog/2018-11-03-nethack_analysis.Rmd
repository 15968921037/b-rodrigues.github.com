## Abstract

In this post, I will analyse the data I scraped and put into an R package, which I called `{nethack}`.
NetHack is a roguelike game; for more context, read my previous blog
[post](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2018-11-01-nethack/).
You can install the `{nethack}` package and play around with the data yourself by installing it from github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("b-rodrigues/nethack")
```

And to use it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(nethack)
data("nethack")
```

The data contains information on games played from 2001 to 2018; 322485 rows and 14 columns. I
will analyze the data in a future blog post. This post focuses on getting and then sharing the
data. By the way, all the content from the public server I scrape is under the CC BY 4.0 license.

I built the package by using the very useful `{devtools}` package. 

## Introduction

What I want from this first analysis are several, simple things: how many players manage to ascend
(meaning, winning), what monster kills most players, and finally extract data from the `dumplog`
column. The `dumplog` column is a bit special; each element of the dumplog column is a log file
that contains a lot of information from the last turns of a player. I will leave this for a future
blog post, though.

Let's load some packages first:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(nethack)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(magrittr)
library(brotools)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(nethack)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(magrittr)
library(brotools)
```

`{brotools}` is my own package that contains some functions that I use daily. If you want to 
install it, run the following line:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("b-rodrigues/brotools")
```

The documentation is not up-to-date, I think I'll do that and release it on CRAN. Some day. 

Now, let's load the "nethack" data, included in the `{nethack}` package:

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("/home/cbrunos/Documents/nethack_dumps/nethack.rda")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(nethack)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data("nethack")

head(nethack)
```

Let's create some variables that might be helpful (or perhaps not, we'll see):

```{r}
nethack %<>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(date),
         year = year(date),
         month = month(date),
         day = day(date))
```

This makes it easy to look at the data from, say, June 2017:

```{r}
nethack %>%
  filter(year == 2017, month == 6) %>%
  brotools::describe()
```

Let's also take a look at a dumplog:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand; the dumplog is quite long</summary>
  
```{r}
nethack %>%
    filter(year == 2018, month == 10) %>%
    slice(1) %>%
    pull(dumplog)
```
</details>

Now, I am curious to see how many games are played per day:

```{r}
runs_per_day <- nethack %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() 


ggplot(runs_per_day, aes(y = n, x = date)) + 
  geom_point(colour = "#0f4150") + 
  geom_smooth(colour = "#82518c") + 
  theme_blog()
```

The number of games seems to be stable since 2015, around 50. But what is also interesting is not 
only the number of games played, but also how many of these games resulted in a win.

For this, let's also add a new column that tells us whether the played *ascended* (won the game) 
or not:

```{r}
nethack %<>%
  mutate(Ascended = ifelse(death == "ascended", "Ascended", "Died an horrible death"))
```

I'm curious to see how many players managed to ascend... NetHack being as hard as diamonds, probably
not a lot:

```{r}
ascensions_per_day <- nethack %>%
  group_by(date, Ascended) %>%
  count() %>%
  rename(Total = n)

ggplot(ascensions_per_day) + 
  geom_area(aes(y = Total, x = as.Date(date), fill = Ascended)) +
  theme_blog() +
  labs(y = "Number of runs", x = "Date") +
  scale_fill_blog() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

Yeah, just as expected. Because there is so much data, it's difficult to see clearly, though. Depending on
the size of the screen you're reading this, it might seem that in some days there are a lot of ascensions.
This is only an impression due to the resolution of the picture. Let's see the share of ascensions per 
year (and how many times the quests fail miserably), and this will become more apparent:

```{r}
ascensions_per_day %>%
  mutate(Year = year(as.Date(date))) %>%
  group_by(Year, Ascended) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(Total, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  mutate(denom = sum(Total, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Share = Total/denom) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(y = Share, x = Year, fill = Ascended)) + 
  theme_blog() + 
  scale_fill_blog() + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

I will now convert the "time" column to seconds. I am not yet sure that this column is really useful,
because NetHack is a turn based game. This means that when the player does not move, neither do the
monsters. So the seconds spent playing might not be a good proxy for actual time spent playing. 
But it makes for a good exercise:

```{r}
convert_to_seconds <- function(time_string){
    time_numeric <- time_string %>%
        str_split(":", simplify = TRUE) %>%
        as.numeric

    time_in_seconds <- sum(time_numeric * c(3600, 60, 1))

    time_in_seconds 
}
```

The strings I want to convert are of the form "01:34:43", so I split at the ":" and then convert
the result to numeric. I end up with an atomic vector (`c(1, 34, 43)`). Then I multiple each element
by the right number of seconds, and sum that to get the total. Let's apply it to my data:

```{r}
nethack %<>%
  mutate(time_in_seconds = map_dbl(time, convert_to_seconds))
```

What is the distribution of "time_in_seconds"?

```{r}
nethack %>%
  describe(time_in_seconds)
```

We see that the minimum of `time_in_seconds` is 61 whereas the maximum is of the order of 27200000...
This must be a mistake, because that is almost one year!

```{r}
nethack %>%
  filter(time_in_seconds == max(time_in_seconds, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Well... maybe "fisted" wanted to break the record of the longest NetHack game ever. Congratulations!

Let's take a look at the density but cut it at 90th percentile:

```{r}
nethack %>%
  filter(!is.na(time_in_seconds),
         time_in_seconds < quantile(time_in_seconds, 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_density(aes(x = time_in_seconds), colour = "#82518c") + 
  theme_blog()
```

As expected, the distribution is right skewed. However, as explained above NetHack is a turn based 
game, meaning that if the player does not move, the monsters won't move either. Perhaps it makes more 
sense to look at the `turns` column:

```{r}
nethack %>%
  describe(turns)
```

The maximum is quite large too. Just like before, let's focus by cutting the variable at the 90th percentile:

```{r}
nethack %>%
  filter(!is.na(turns),
         turns < quantile(turns, 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_density(aes(x = turns), colour = "#82518c") + 
  theme_blog()
```

I think that using `turns` makes more sense. In the a future blog post, I will estimate a survival
model and see how long players survive, and will use `turns` instead of `time_in_seconds`. 

## Analysis

### What kills the players

To know what kills players so much, some cleaning of the `death` column is in order. Death can 
occur from poisoning, starvation, accidents, drowning... of course monsters can kill the player too.
Here are some values of the `death` variable:

```
burned by a tower of flame
choked on a lichen corpse
died of starvation
fell into a pit of iron spikes
killed by a gnome
killed by a gnome called Blabla
killed by a gnome called Blabla while sleeping
slipped while mounting a saddled pony
slipped while mounting a saddled pony called Jolly Jumper
zapped her/himself with a spell
```

To know what is the most frequent cause of death, I have to do some cleaning, because if not,
"killed by a gnome" and "killed by a gnome called Blabla" would be two different causes of death.
In the end, what interests me is to know how many times the player got killed by a gnome. 

The following lines do a cleanup of the `death` variable:

```{r}
nethack %<>% 
  mutate(death2 = case_when(str_detect(death, "poisoned") ~ "poisoned",
                            str_detect(death, "slipped") ~ "accident",
                            str_detect(death, "petrified") ~ "petrified",
                            str_detect(death, "choked") ~ "accident",
                            str_detect(death, "caught.*self") ~ "accident",
                            str_detect(death, "starvation") ~ "starvation",
                            str_detect(death, "drowned") ~ "drowned",
                            str_detect(death, "fell") ~ "fell",
                            str_detect(death, "zapped") ~ "zapped",
                            str_detect(death, "killed") ~ "killed",
                            TRUE ~ death)) %>%
  mutate(death3 = str_extract(death, "(?<=by|while).*")) %>%
  mutate(death3 = case_when(str_detect(death3, ",|\\bcalled\\b") ~ str_extract(death3, "(.*?),|(.*?)\\bcalled\\b"), 
                            TRUE ~ death3)) %>%
  mutate(death3 = str_remove(death3, ",|called|\\ban?"),
         death3 = str_trim(death3))
```

`death2` is a new variable, in which I broadly categorize causes of death. Using regular expressions
I detect causes of death and aggregate some categories, for instance "slipped" and "chocked" into 
"accident". Then, I want to extract everything that comes  after the strings "by" or while, and put
the result into a new variable called `death3`. Then I detect the string "," or "called"; if one 
of these strings is present, I extract everything that comes before "," or that comes before 
"called". Finally, I remove ",", "called" or "a" or "an" from the string and trim the whitespaces.

Let's take a look at these new variables:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
nethack %>%
    select(name, death, death2, death3) %>%
    sample_n(10)
```

Now, it is quite easy to know what monsters are the meanest buttholes; let's focus on the top 15.
Most likely, these are going to be early game monsters. Let' see:

```{r}
nethack %>%
    filter(!is.na(death3)) %>%
    count(death3) %>%
    top_n(15) %>%
    mutate(death3 = fct_reorder(death3, n, .desc = FALSE)) %>%
    ggplot() + 
    geom_col(aes(y = n, x = death3)) + 
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_blog() + 
    scale_fill_blog() + 
    ylab("Number of deaths caused") +
    xlab("Monster")
```

Seems like soldier ants are the baddest, followed by jackals and dwarfs. As expected, these are
mostly early game monsters. Thus, it would be interesting to look at this distribution, but at 
different stages in the game. Let's create a categorical variable that discretizes `turns`,
and then create one plot per category:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  

```{r}
nethack %>%
    filter(!is.na(death3)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(turns)) %>%
    mutate(turn_flag = case_when(between(turns, 1, 5000) ~ "Less than 5000",
                                 between(turns, 5001, 10000) ~ "Between 5001 and 10000",
                                 between(turns, 10001, 20000) ~ "Between 10001 and 20000",
                                 between(turns, 20001, 40000) ~ "Between 20001 and 40000",
                                 between(turns, 40001, 60000) ~ "Between 40001 and 60000",
                                 turns > 60000 ~ "More than 60000")) %>%
    mutate(turn_flag = factor(turn_flag, levels = c("Less than 5000", 
                                                    "Between 5001 and 10000",
                                                    "Between 10001 and 20000",
                                                    "Between 20001 and 40000",
                                                    "Between 40001 and 60000",
                                                    "More than 60000"), ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    group_by(turn_flag) %>%
    count(death3) %>%
    top_n(15) %>%
    nest() %>%
    mutate(data = map(data, ~mutate(., death3 = fct_reorder(death3, n, .desc = TRUE))))  %>%
    mutate(plots = map2(.x = turn_flag,
                         .y = data,
                         ~ggplot(data = .y) + 
                             geom_col(aes(y = n, x = death3)) + 
                             coord_flip() + 
                             theme_blog() + 
                             scale_fill_blog() + 
                             ylab("Number of deaths caused") +
                             xlab("Monster") + 
                             ggtitle(.x))) %>%
    pull(plots)
```
</details>

Finally, for this section, I want to know if there are levels, or floors, where players die more
often than others. For this, we can take a look at the `lev_max` column. Observations in this 
column are of the form "8/10". This means that the player died on level 8, but the lowest level
that was explored was the 10th. Let's do this for the year 2017 first. Before anything, I have
to explain the layout of the levels of the game. You can see a diagram
[here](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Mazes_of_Menace#Map). The player starts on floor 1, 
and goes down to level 53. Then, the player can ascend, by going on levels -1 to -5. But there
are more levels than these ones. -6 and -9 are the sky, and the player can teleport there (but will
fall to his death). If the player teleports to level -10, he'll enter heaven (and die too). Because
these levels are special, I do not consider them here. I do not consider level 0 either, which is 
"Nowhere". Let's get the number of players who died on each floor, but also compute the cumulative 
death count:

```{r}
died_on_level <- nethack %>%
    filter(Ascended == "Died an horrible death") %>%
    mutate(died_on = str_extract(lev_max, "-?\\d{1,}")) %>%
    mutate(died_on = as.numeric(died_on)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    count(died_on) %>% 
    filter(died_on >= -5, died_on != 0) %>%
    mutate(died_on = case_when(died_on == -1 ~ 54,
                               died_on == -2 ~ 55,
                               died_on == -3 ~ 56,
                               died_on == -4 ~ 57,
                               died_on == -5 ~ 58,
                               TRUE ~ died_on)) %>%
    arrange(desc(died_on)) %>%
    mutate(cumul_deaths = cumsum(n))
```

Let's take a look:

```{r}
head(died_on_level)
```

Now, let's compute the number of players who ascended and add this to the cumulative count:

```{r}
ascended_yearly <- nethack %>%
    filter(Ascended == "Ascended") %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    count(Ascended)
```

Let's take a look:

```{r}
head(ascended_yearly)
```

I will modify the dataset a little bit and merge it with the previous one:

```{r}
ascended_yearly %<>%
  rename(ascended_players = `n`) %>%
  select(-Ascended)
```

Let's add this to the data frame from before by merging both, and then we can compute the 
surviving players:

```{r}
died_on_level %<>%
  full_join(ascended_yearly, by = "year") %>%
  mutate(surviving_players = cumul_deaths + ascended_players)
```

Now we can compute the share of players who died on each level:

```{r}
died_on_level %>%
    mutate(death_rate = n/surviving_players) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = death_rate, x = as.factor(died_on))) + 
    geom_line(aes(group = year, alpha = year), colour = "#82518c") +
    theme_blog() + 
    ylab("Death rate") +
    xlab("Level") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
          legend.position = "none") + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

Looks like level 7 is consistently the most dangerous! The death rate there is more than 35%!

That's it for this blog post, in the next one, I will focus on what players kill!
