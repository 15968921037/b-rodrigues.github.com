I am currently working on a package for the R programming language; its initial goal was to simply
distribute the data used in the Card and Krueger 1994 paper that you can read 
[here](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf) (PDF warning). However, I decided that I
would add code to perform diff-in-diff.

In my [previous blog post](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2019-04-28-diffindiff_part1/) I showed 
how to set up the structure of your new package. In this blog post, I will only focus on getting 
Card and Krueger's data and prepare it for distribution. The next blog posts will focus on writing
a function to perform difference-in-differences.

If you want to distribute data through a package, you first need to use the `usethis::use_data_raw()`
function (as shown in part 1).

This creates a `data-raw` folder, and inside you will find the `DATASET.R` script. You can edit this
script to prepare the data.

First, let's download the data from Card's website, unzip it and load the data into R. All these 
operations will be performed from R:

``` r
library(tidyverse)

tempfile_path <- tempfile()

download.file("http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/data_sets/njmin.zip", destfile = tempfile_path)

tempdir_path <- tempdir()

unzip(tempfile_path, exdir = tempdir_path)
```

To download and unzip a file from R, first, you need to define where you want to save the file. Because 
I am not interested in keeping the downloaded file, I use the `tempfile()` function to get a temporary
file in my `/tmp/` folder (which is the folder that contains temporary files and folders in a GNU+Linux
system). Then, using `download.file()` I download the file, and save it in my temporary file. I then
create a temporary directory using `tempdir()` (the idea is the same as with `tempfile()`), and use
this folder to save the files that I will unzip, using the `unzip()` function. This folder now contains
several files:

```
check.sas
codebook
public.csv
read.me
survey1.nj
survey2.nj
```

`check.sas` is the SAS script Card and Krueger used. It's interesting, because it is quite simple,
quite short (170 lines long) and yet the impact of Card and Krueger's research was and has been 
very important for the field of econometrics. This script will help me define my own functions.
`codebook`, you guessed it, contains the variables' descriptions. I will use this to name the columns
of the data and to write the dataset's documentation.

`public.csv` is the data. It does not contain any column names:

```

```

Missing data is defined by `.` and the delimiter is the space character. `read.me` is a README file.
Finally, `survey1.nj` and `survey2.nj` are the surveys that were administered to the fast food 
restaurants' managers; one in February (before the raise) and the second one in November 
(after the minimum wage raise).

The next lines import the codebook:

``` r
codebook <- read_lines(file = paste0(tempdir_path, "/codebook"))

variable_names <- codebook %>%
    `[`(8:59) %>%
    `[`(-c(5, 6, 13, 14, 32, 33)) %>%
    str_sub(1, 13) %>%
    str_squish() %>%
    str_to_lower()
```

Once I import the codebook, I select lines 8 to 59 using the `` `r "\u0060[\u0060()"` `` function.
If you're not familiar with this notation, try the following in a console:

```{r}
seq(1, 100)[1:10]
```

and compare:

```{r}
seq(1, 100) %>% 
  `[`(., 1:10)
```

both are equivalent, as you can see. You can also try the following:


```{r}
1 + 10
```

```{r}
1 %>% 
  `+`(., 10)
```
Using the same trick, I remove lines that I do not need, and then using `stringr::str_sub(1, 13)` 
I only keep the first 13 characters (which are the variable names, plus some white space characters)
and then, to remove all the unneeded white space characters I use `stringr::squish()`, and then 
change the column names to lowercase.

I then load the data, and add the column names that I extracted before:

``` r
dataset <- read_table2(paste0(tempdir_path, "/public.dat"),
                      col_names = FALSE)

dataset <- dataset %>%
    select(-X47) %>%
    `colnames<-`(., variable_names) %>%
    mutate_all(as.numeric) %>%
    mutate(sheet = as.character(sheet))
```

I use the same trick as before. I rename the 47th column, which is empty,
I name the columns with `` `r "\u0060colnames<-\u0060()"` ``.

After this, I perform some data cleaning. It's mostly renaming categories of categorical variables,
and creating a "true" panel format. Several variables were measured at several points in time. Variables
that were measured a second time have a "2" at the end of their name. I remove these variables, 
and add an observation data variable. So my data as twice as many rows as the original data, but
that format makes it way easier to work with. Below you can read the full code:

                               status2 == 5 ~ "Closed due to Mall fire")) %>%
    mutate(co_owned = if_else(co_owned == 1, "Yes", "No")) %>%
    mutate(bonus = if_else(bonus == 1, "Yes", "No")) %>%
    mutate(special2 = if_else(special2 == 1, "Yes", "No")) %>%
    mutate(type2 = if_else(type2 == 1, "Phone", "Personal")) %>%
    select(sheet, chain, co_owned, state, region, everything()) %>%
    select(-southj, -centralj, -northj, -shore, -pa1, -pa2) %>%
    mutate(date2 = lubridate::mdy(date2)) %>%
    rename(open2 = open2r) %>%
    rename(firstinc2 = firstin2)

dataset1 <- dataset %>%
    select(-ends_with("2"), -sheet, -chain, -co_owned, -state, -region, -bonus) %>%
    mutate(type = NA_character_,
           status = NA_character_,
           date = NA)

dataset2 <- dataset %>%
    select(ends_with("2")) %>%
    #mutate(bonus = NA_character_) %>%
    rename_all(~str_remove(., "2"))

other_cols <- dataset %>%
    select(sheet, chain, co_owned, state, region, bonus)

other_cols_1 <- other_cols %>%
    mutate(observation = "February 1992")

other_cols_2 <- other_cols %>%
    mutate(observation = "November 1992")

dataset1 <- bind_cols(other_cols_1, dataset1)
dataset2 <- bind_cols(other_cols_2, dataset2)

njmin <- bind_rows(dataset1, dataset2) %>%
    select(sheet, chain, state, region, observation, everything())
```
</details>


The line I would like to comment is the following:

``` r
dataset %>%
    select(-ends_with("2"), -sheet, -chain, -co_owned, -state, -region, -bonus)
```

This select removes every column that ends with the character "2" (among others). I split the data
in two, to then bind the rows together and thus create my long dataset. I then save the data
into the `data/` folder:

``` r
usethis::use_data(njmin, overwrite = TRUE)
```

This saves the data as an `.rda` file. To enable users to read the data by typing `data("njmin")`,
you need to create a `data.R` script in the `R/` folder. You can read my `data.R` script below:

I have documented the data, and using `roxygen2::royxgenise()` to create the dataset's documentation.

The data can now be used to create some nifty plots:

```{r}


ggplot(njmin, aes(wage_st)) + geom_density(aes(fill = state), alpha = 0.3) +
    facet_wrap(vars(observation)) + theme_blog() +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank(), plot.caption = element_text(colour = "white")) +
    labs(title = "Distribution of starting wage rates in fast food restaurants",
         caption = "On April 1st, 1992, New Jersey's minimum wage rose from $4.25 to $5.05. Source: Card and Krueger (1994)")
```

In the next blog post, I am going to write a first function to perform diff and diff, and we will 
learn how to make it available to users, document and test it!
