Yesterday IÂ wrote [this blog post](http://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2018-04-14-playing_with_furrr/)
which showed how one could use `{furrr}` and `{mice}` to impute missing data in parallel, thus
speeding up the process tremendously.

To make using this snippet of code easier, I quickly cobbled together an experimental package
called `{pmice}` that you can install from Github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("b-rodrigues/pmice")
```

For now, it returns a list of `mids` objects and not a `mids` object like `mice::mice()` does, 
but I'll be working on it. Contributions welcome!
