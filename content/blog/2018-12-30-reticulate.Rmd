This short blog post illustrates how easy it is to use R and Python in the same R Notebook thanks to the 
`{reticulate}` package. For this to work, you might need to upgrade RStudio to the [current preview version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).
Let's start by importing `{reticulate}`:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

`{reticulate}` is an RStudio package that provides "*a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability
between Python and R*". With it, it is possible to call Python and use Python libraries within 
an R session, or define Python chunks in R markdown. I think that using R Notebooks is the best way
to work with Python and R; when you want to use Python, you simply use a Python chunk:

    ```{python}`r ''`
    your python code here
    ```

There's even autocompletion for Python object methods:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/autocompletion.png")
```

Fantastic!

However, if you wish to use Python interactively within your R session, you must start the Python
REPL with the `repl_python()` function, which starts a Python REPL. You can then do whatever you 
want, even access objects from your R session, and then when you exit the REPL, any object you 
created in Python remains accessible in R. I think that using Python this way is a bit more involved
and would advise using R Notebooks if you need to use both languages.

I installed the Anaconda Python distribution to have Python on my system. To use it with `{reticulate}`
I must first use the `use_python()` function that allows me to set which version of Python I want
to use:

```{r}
# This is an R chunk
use_python("~/miniconda3/bin/python")
```

I can now load a dataset, still using R:

```{r}
# This is an R chunk
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

and now, to access the `mtcars` data frame, I simply use the `r` object:

```{python}
# This is a Python chunk
print(r.mtcars.describe())
```

`.describe()` is a Python Pandas DataFrame method to get summary statistics of our data. This means that
`mtcars` was automatically converted from a `tibble` object to a Pandas DataFrame! Let's check its type:

```{python}
# This is a Python chunk
print(type(r.mtcars))
```

Let's save the summary statistics in a variable:

```{python}
# This is a Python chunk
summary_mtcars = r.mtcars.describe()
```

Let's access this from R, by using the `py` object:

```{r}
# This is an R chunk
class(py$summary_mtcars)
```

Let's try something more complex. Let's first fit a linear model in Python, and see how R sees it:

```{python}
# This is a Python chunk
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

model = smf.ols('mpg ~ hp', data = r.mtcars).fit()

print(model.summary())
```

Just for fun, I ran the linear regression with the Scikit-learn library too:

```{python}
# This is a Python chunk
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
regressor = LinearRegression()  

x = r.mtcars[["hp"]]
y = r.mtcars[["mpg"]]

model_scikit = regressor.fit(x, y)

print(model_scikit.intercept_)
print(model_scikit.coef_)
```

Let's access the `model` variable in R and see what type of object it is in R:

```{r}
# This is an R chunk
model_r <- py$model
class(model_r)
```

So because this is a custom Python object, it does not get converted into the equivalent R object.
This is described [here](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html). However, you can still
use Python methods from within an R chunk!

```{r}
# This is an R chunk
model_r$aic

model_r$params
```

I must say that I am very impressed with the `{reticulate}` package. I think that even if you are 
primarily a Python user, this is still very interesting to know in case you need a specific function
from an R package. Just write all your script inside a Python Markdown chunk and then use the R
function you need from an R chunk! Of course there is also a way to use R from Python, a Python library
called `rpy2` but I am not very familiar with it. From what I read, it seems to be also quite
simple to use.
