I've been using GNU+Linux distros for about 10 years now, and have settled for openSUSE as my main operating system around 3 years ago, perhaps even more. If you're a gamer, you might have heard about SteamOS
and how more and more games are available on GNU+Linux. I don't really care about
games, I play the occasional one (currently [Tangledeep](http://www.tangledeep.com/)) when I find
the time, but still follow the news about gaming on GNU+Linux. Last week,
Valve announced something quite big; it is now possible to run Windows games on GNU+Linux directly 
from Steam, using a modified version of [Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)) 
they call Proton. The feature is still in Beta, and Valve announced that they guarantee around 
30 games to work already flawlessly. Of course, people have tried running a lot of other games, and,
as was to be expected from Free Software and Open Source fans, GNU+Linux gamers created a Google Sheet
that lists which games were tried and how they run. You can take a look at the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DcZZQ4HL_Ol969UbXJmFG8TzOHNnHoj8Q1f8DIFe8-8/htmlview?sle=true&pru=AAABZbqTTkc*IvT11ShwA2kjoe_4lPefiQ#gid=1003113831).

In this blog post, I will play around with this sheet. This blog post lists some `{tidyverse}` tricks
I find useful and use often. Perhaps these tricks will be useful to you too! Let's start by loading
the needed packages:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(readxl)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(readxl)
```

Since I'm lazy and don't want to type the whole name of the file I'll be using some little regex:

```{r}
steam <- read_excel(Sys.glob("Steam*"), sheet = "Main", skip = 2)

glimpse(steam)
```

Let's count how many unique games are in the data:

```{r}
steam %>%
    count(Game)
```

That's quite a lot of games! However, not everyone of them is playable:

```{r}
steam %>%
    count(Status)
```

Around 2500 have the status "Platinum", but some games might have more than one status:

```{r}
steam %>%
    filter(Game == "100% Orange Juice") %>%
    count(Status)
```

More games run like *Garbage* than *Platinum*. But perhaps we can dig a little deeper and see if 
we find some patterns.

Let's take a look at the GNU+Linux distros:

```{r}
steam %>%
    count(Distro) 
```

Ok the distro column is pretty messy. Let's try to bring some order to it:

```{r}
steam %<>%
    mutate(distribution = as_factor(case_when(
        grepl("buntu|lementary|antergos|steam|mint|18.|pop|neon", Distro, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Ubuntu",
        grepl("arch|manjaro", Distro, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Arch Linux",
        grepl("gentoo", Distro, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Gentoo",
        grepl("fedora", Distro, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Fedora",
        grepl("suse", Distro, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "openSUSE",
        grepl("debian|sid|stretch|lmde", Distro, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Debian",
        grepl("solus", Distro, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Solus",
        grepl("slackware", Distro, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Slackware",
        grepl("void", Distro, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Void Linux",
        TRUE ~ "Other"
    )))
```

The `%<>%` operator is shorthand for `a <- a %>% f()`. It passes `a` to `f()` and assigns the
result back to `a`. Anyways, let's take a look at the `distribution` column:

```{r}
steam %>%
    count(distribution)
```

I will group distributions that have less than 100 occurrences into a single category
(meaning I will keep the 5 more common values):

```{r}
steam %<>%
    mutate(distribution = fct_lump(distribution, n = 5, other_level = "Other")) 

steam %>%
    count(distribution)
```

Let's do the same for the CPUs:

```{r}
steam %<>%
    mutate(CPU = as_factor(case_when(
        grepl("intel|i\\d|xeon|core2|\\d{4}k|q\\d{4}|pentium", Specs, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Intel",
        grepl("ryzen|threadripper|tr|amd|fx|r\\d|\\d{4}x|phenom", Specs, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "AMD",
        TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )))

steam %>%
    count(CPU)
```

And the same for the GPUs:

```{r}
steam %<>%
    mutate(GPU = as_factor(case_when(
        grepl("nvidia|geforce|3\\d{2}|nouveau|gtx|gt\\s?\\d{1,}|9\\d0|1060|1070|1080", Specs, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Nvidia",
        grepl("amd|radeon|ati|rx|vega|r9", Specs, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "AMD",
        grepl("intel|igpu|integrated|hd\\d{4}|hd\\sgraphics", Specs, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Intel",
        TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )))

steam %>%
    count(GPU)
```

I will also add a rank for the `Status` column:

```{r}
steam %<>%
    mutate(rank_status = case_when(
        Status == "Platinum" ~ 5,
        Status == "Gold" ~ 4,
        Status == "Silver" ~ 3,
        Status == "Bronze" ~ 2,
        Status == "Garbage" ~ 1
    ))
```

Now, what are the top 5 most frequent combinations of Status, distribution, CPU and GPU?

```{r}
steam %>%
    filter(!is.na(CPU), !is.na(GPU)) %>%
    count(Status, distribution, CPU, GPU) %>%
    mutate(total = sum(n)) %>%
    mutate(freq = n / total) %>%
    top_n(5)
```

Unsurprisingly, Ubuntu, or distributions using Ubuntu as a base, are the most popular ones. Nvidia
is the most popular GPU, Intel for CPUs and in most cases, this combo of hardware and distribution
is associated with positive ratings (even though there are almost as many "Garbage" ratings than
"Platinum" ratings).

Now let's compute some dumb averages of Statuses by distribution, CPU and GPU. Since I'm going
to run the same computation three times, I'll write a function to do that.

```{r}
compute_avg <- function(dataset, var){
    var <- enquo(var)
    dataset %>%
        select(rank_status, (!!var)) %>%
        group_by((!!var)) %>%
        mutate(wt = n()) %>%
        summarise(average_rating = weighted.mean(rank_status, (!!var), wt, na.rm = TRUE))
}
```

Let's see now if we can rank distribution by Steam play rating:

```{r}
compute_avg(steam, distribution)
```

How about for hardware?

```{r}
compute_avg(steam, GPU)
```

```{r}
compute_avg(steam, CPU)
```

To wrap this up, what are the games with the most ratings? Perhaps this can give us a hint about which
games GNU+Linux users prefer:

```{r}
steam %>%
    count(Game) %>%
    top_n(10)
```

I actually laughed out loud when I saw that DOOM was the game with the most ratings! What else 
was I expecting, really.
