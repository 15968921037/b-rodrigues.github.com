## Abstract

You can find the data used in this blog post here: https://github.com/b-rodrigues/elections_lux

This is a follow up to a [previous blog post](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2018-10-21-lux_elections/)
where I extracted data of the 2018 Luxembourguish elections from Excel Workbooks. 
Now that I have the data, I will create a map of Luxembourg by commune, with pie charts of the 
results on top of each commune! To do this, I use good ol' `{ggplot2}` and another packages 
called `{scatterpie}`. As a bonus, I have added the code to extract the data from the 2013 
elections from Excel. You'll find this code in the appendix at the end of the blog post.

## Introduction

Before importing the data for the elections of  2018, let's install some packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('rgeos', type='source') # Dependency of rgdal
install.packages('rgdal', type='source') # To read in the shapefile
```

These packages might be very tricky to install on OSX and Linux, but they're needed to import the
shapefile of the country, which is needed to draw a map. So to make things easier, I have 
created an `rds` object, from the shapefile of Luxembourg, that you can import natively in R without
needing these two packages. But if you want to use them, here is how:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
communes <- readOGR("Limadmin_SHP/LIMADM_COMMUNES.shp")
```

By the way, you can download the shapefile for Luxembourg [here](https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/limites-administratives-du-grand-duche-de-luxembourg/#_).

I'll use my shapefile though (that you can download from the same github repo as the data):

```{r}
communes_df <- readRDS("commune_shapefile.rds")
```

Here's how it looks like:

```{r}
head(communes_df)
```

Now let's load some packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("tidyxl")
library("ggplot2")
library("scatterpie")
```

Ok, now, let's import the elections results data, which is the output of 
[last week's blog post](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2018-10-21-lux_elections/):

```{r}
elections <- read_csv("elections_2018.csv")
```

I will only focus on the data at the commune level, and only use the share of votes for each party:

```{r}
elections_map <- elections %>%
    filter(division == "Commune",
           Variables == "Pourcentage")
```

Now I need to make sure that the names of the communes are the same between the elections data
and the shapefile. Usual suspects are the "Haute-Sûre" and the "Redange-sur-Attert" communes, 
but let's take a look:

```{r}
locality_elections <- unique(elections_map$locality)
locality_shapefile <- unique(communes_df$id)

setdiff(locality_elections, locality_shapefile)
```

Yep, exactly as expected. I've had problems with the names of these two communes in the past already.
Let's rename these two communes in the elections data:

```{r}
elections_map <- elections_map %>%
    mutate(commune = case_when(locality == "Lac de la Haute-Sûre" ~ "Lac de la Haute Sûre",
                          locality == "Redange Attert" ~ "Redange",
                          TRUE ~ locality))
```

Now, I can select the relevant columns from the shapefile:

```{r}
communes_df <- communes_df %>%
    select(long, lat, commune = id)
```

and from the elections data:

```{r}
elections_map <- elections_map %>%
    select(commune, Party, Variables, Values)
```

## Plotting the data on a map

Now, for the type of plot I want to make, using the `{scatterpie}` package, I need the data to be 
in the wide format, not long. For this I will use `tidyr::spread()`:

```{r}
elections_map <- elections_map %>% 
    spread(Party, Values)
```

This is how the data looks now:

```{r}
glimpse(elections_map)
```

For this to work, I need two datasets; one to draw the map (`commune_df`) and one to draw the 
pie charts over each commune, with the data to draw the charts, but also the position of where I 
want the pie charts. For this, I will compute the average of the longitude and latitude, which
should be good enough:

```{r}
scatterpie_data <- communes_df %>%
    group_by(commune) %>%
    summarise(long = mean(long),
              lat = mean(lat))
```

Now, let's join the two datasets:

```{r}
final_data <- left_join(scatterpie_data, elections_map, by = "commune") 
```

I have all the ingredients to finally plot the data:

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
ggplot() +
    geom_polygon(data = communes_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = commune), colour = "grey", fill = NA) +
    geom_scatterpie(data = final_data, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=commune), 
                    cols = c("ADR", "CSV", "déi gréng", "déi Lénk", "DP", "KPL", "LSAP", "PIRATEN")) +
    labs(title = "Share of total vote in each commune, 2018 elections") +
    theme_void() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.title = element_blank(),
          legend.text = element_text(colour = "white"),
          plot.background = element_rect("#272b30"),
          plot.title = element_text(colour = "white")) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("ADR" = "#009dd1",
                                 "CSV" = "#ee7d00",
                                 "déi gréng" = "#45902c",
                                 "déi Lénk" = "#e94067",
                                 "DP" = "#002a54",
                                 "KPL" = "#ff0000",
                                 "LSAP" = "#ad3648",
                                 "PIRATEN" = "#ad5ea9"))
```

Not too bad, but we can't really read anything from the pie charts. I will now make their size 
proportional to the number of voters in each commune. For this, I need to go back to the Excel
sheets, and look for the right cell:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/electeurs_inscrits.png")
```

It will be easy to extract this info. It located in cell "E5":

```{r}
elections_raw_2018 <- xlsx_cells("leg-2018-10-14-22-58-09-737.xlsx")

electors_commune <- elections_raw_2018 %>%
    filter(!(sheet %in% c("Le Grand-Duché de Luxembourg", "Centre", "Est", "Nord", "Sud", "Sommaire"))) %>%
    filter(address == "E5") %>%
    select(sheet, numeric) %>%
    rename(commune = sheet,
           electors = numeric)
```

I can now add this to the data:

```{r}
final_data <- final_data %>% 
    full_join(electors_commune) %>%
    mutate(log_electors = log(electors) * 200)
```

In the last line, I create a new column called `log_electors` that I then multiply by 200. This
will be useful later.

Now I can add the `r` argument inside the `aes()` function on the third line, to make the pie chart
size proportional to the number of electors in that commune:

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = communes_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = commune), colour = "grey", fill = NA) +
    geom_scatterpie(data = final_data, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = commune, r = electors), 
                    cols = c("ADR", "CSV", "déi gréng", "déi Lénk", "DP", "KPL", "LSAP", "PIRATEN")) +
    labs(title = "Share of total vote in each commune, 2018 elections") +
    theme_void() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.title = element_blank(),
          legend.text = element_text(colour = "white"),
          plot.background = element_rect("#272b30"),
          plot.title = element_text(colour = "white")) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("ADR" = "#009dd1",
                                 "CSV" = "#ee7d00",
                                 "déi gréng" = "#45902c",
                                 "déi Lénk" = "#182024",
                                 "DP" = "#002a54",
                                 "KPL" = "#ff0000",
                                 "LSAP" = "#ad3648",
                                 "PIRATEN" = "#ad5ea9"))
```

Ok, that was not a good idea! Perhaps the best option would be to have one map per circonscription. 
For this, I need the list of communes by circonscription. This is available on Wikipedia. Here are
the lists:

```{r}
centre <- c("Bissen", "Colmar-Berg", "Fischbach", "Heffingen", "Larochette",
            "Lintgen", "Lorentzweiler", "Mersch", "Nommern", "Helperknapp", "Bertrange", "Contern", 
            "Hesperange", "Luxembourg", "Niederanven", "Sandweiler", "Schuttrange", "Steinsel", 
            "Strassen", "Walferdange", "Weiler-la-Tour")

est <- c("Beaufort", "Bech", "Berdorf", "Consdorf", "Echternach", "Rosport-Mompach", "Waldbillig",
         "Betzdorf", "Biwer", "Flaxweiler", "Grevenmacher", "Junglinster", "Manternach", "Mertert",
         "Wormeldange","Bous", "Dalheim", "Lenningen", "Mondorf-les-Bains", "Remich", "Schengen",
         "Stadtbredimus", "Waldbredimus")

nord <- c("Clervaux", "Parc Hosingen", "Troisvierges", "Weiswampach", "Wincrange", "Bettendorf", 
          "Bourscheid", "Diekirch", "Erpeldange-sur-Sûre", "Ettelbruck", "Feulen", "Mertzig", "Reisdorf", 
          "Schieren", "Vallée de l'Ernz", "Beckerich", "Ell", "Grosbous", "Préizerdaul", 
          "Rambrouch", "Redange", "Saeul", "Useldange", "Vichten", "Wahl", "Putscheid", "Tandel",
          "Vianden", "Boulaide", "Esch-sur-Sûre", "Goesdorf", "Kiischpelt", "Lac de la Haute Sûre",
          "Wiltz", "Winseler")

sud <- c("Dippach", "Garnich", "Käerjeng", "Kehlen", "Koerich", "Kopstal", "Mamer", 
         "Habscht", "Steinfort", "Bettembourg", "Differdange", "Dudelange", "Esch-sur-Alzette", 
         "Frisange", "Kayl", "Leudelange", "Mondercange", "Pétange", "Reckange-sur-Mess", "Roeser",
         "Rumelange", "Sanem", "Schifflange")

circonscriptions <- list("centre" = centre, "est" = est,
                         "nord" = nord, "sud" = sud)
```

Now, I can make one map per circonscription. First, let's split the data sets by circonscription:

```{r}
communes_df_by_circonscription <- circonscriptions %>%
    map(~filter(communes_df, commune %in% .))

final_data_by_circonscription <- circonscriptions %>%
    map(~filter(final_data, commune %in% .))
```

By using `pmap()`, I can reuse the code to generate the plot to each element of the two lists. 
This is nice because I do not need to copy and paste the code 4 times:

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
pmap(list(x = communes_df_by_circonscription,
          y = final_data_by_circonscription,
          z = names(communes_df_by_circonscription)),
     function(x, y, z){
         ggplot() +
        geom_polygon(data = x, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = commune), 
                     colour = "grey", fill = NA) +
        geom_scatterpie(data = y, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = commune), 
                        cols = c("ADR", "CSV", "déi gréng", "déi Lénk", "DP", "KPL", "LSAP", "PIRATEN")) +
        labs(title = paste0("Share of total vote in each commune, 2018 elections for circonscription ", z)) +
        theme_void() +
        theme(legend.position = "bottom",
              legend.title = element_blank(),
              legend.text = element_text(colour = "white"),
              plot.background = element_rect("#272b30"),
              plot.title = element_text(colour = "white")) + 
        scale_fill_manual(values = c("ADR" = "#009dd1",
                                     "CSV" = "#ee7d00",
                                     "déi gréng" = "#45902c",
                                     "déi Lénk" = "#182024",
                                     "DP" = "#002a54",
                                     "KPL" = "#ff0000",
                                     "LSAP" = "#ad3648",
                                     "PIRATEN" = "#ad5ea9"))
     }
)
```

I created an anonymous function of three argument, `x`, `y` and `z`. If you are unfamiliar with 
`pmap()`, study the above code closely. If you have questions, do not hesitate to reach out!

The pie charts are still quite small, but if I try to change the size of the pie charts,
I'll have the same problem as before: inside the same circonscription, some communes have really a
lot of electors, and some a very small number. Perhaps I can try with the log of the electors?

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
pmap(list(x = communes_df_by_circonscription,
          y = final_data_by_circonscription,
          z = names(communes_df_by_circonscription)),
     function(x, y, z){
         ggplot() +
        geom_polygon(data = x, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = commune), 
                     colour = "grey", fill = NA) +
        geom_scatterpie(data = y, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = commune, r = log_electors), 
                        cols = c("ADR", "CSV", "déi gréng", "déi Lénk", "DP", "KPL", "LSAP", "PIRATEN")) +
        labs(title = paste0("Share of total vote in each commune, 2018 elections for circonscription ", z)) +
        theme_void() +
        theme(legend.position = "bottom",
              legend.title = element_blank(),
              legend.text = element_text(colour = "white"),
              plot.background = element_rect("#272b30"),
              plot.title = element_text(colour = "white")) + 
        scale_fill_manual(values = c("ADR" = "#009dd1",
                                     "CSV" = "#ee7d00",
                                     "déi gréng" = "#45902c",
                                     "déi Lénk" = "#182024",
                                     "DP" = "#002a54",
                                     "KPL" = "#ff0000",
                                     "LSAP" = "#ad3648",
                                     "PIRATEN" = "#ad5ea9"))
     }
)
```

This looks better now!

## Conclusion

Having data in a machine readable format is really important. The amount of code I had to write
to go from the Excel Workbooks that contained the data to this plots is quite large, but if the
data was in a machine readable format to start with, I could have focused on the plots immediately.

The good thing is that I got to practice my skills and discovered `{scatterpie}`!

## Appendix


The following lines of code extract the data (from the 2013 elections) from the Excel Workbooks
that can be found in Luxembourguish [Open Data Portal](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/elections-legislatives-2013-donnees-officieuses/#_).


I will not comment them, as they work in a similar way than in the previous blog post where I 
extracted the data from the 2018 elections. The only difference, is that the sheet with the
national level data was totally different, so I did not extract it. The first reason is because
I don't need it for this blog post, the second is because I was lazy. For me, that's two pretty 
good reasons not to do something. If you have a question concerning the code below, don't 
hesitate to reach out though!
