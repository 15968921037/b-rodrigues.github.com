## Introduction

Luxembourg, as any proper European country, is full of castles. According to Wikipedia, 

"By some optimistic estimates, there are as many as 130 castles in Luxembourg but more realistically
there are probably just over a hundred, although many of these could be considered large residences 
or manor houses rather than castles".

I see the editors are probably German or French, calling our castles *manor houses*! They only say
that because Luxembourg is small, so our castles must be small too, right?

Banter aside, with that many castles, what is the best way to visit them all? And by best way I mean 
shortest way. This is a classical **Travelling salesman problem**. To solve this, I need the following elements:

* A list of castles to visit, with their coordinates
* The distances between these castles to each other
* A program to solve the TSP

Let's start by loading some packages:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(rvest)
library(curl)
library(brotools)
library(RJSONIO)
library(TSP)
library(ggimage)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(rvest)
library(curl)
library(brotools)
library(RJSONIO)
library(TSP)
library(ggimage)
```

First step; scrape the data.

## Scraping the data (that's the data science part)

```{r, include=FALSE}
castles <- read_csv("castles_clean.csv")
```

Let's start by having a list of castles. For this, I go to the French Wikipedia page of 
[Luxembourguish castles](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_de_ch%C3%A2teaux_luxembourgeois).

The Luxembourguish page is more [exhaustive](https://lb.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%ABscht_vun_de_L%C3%ABtzebuerger_Buergen_a_Schl%C3%A4sser), 
but the names are in Luxembourguish, and I doubt that
OpenStreetMap, which I'll use to get the coordinates, understands Luxembourguish.

This list has around 50 castles, a reasonable amount of castles. Scraping the table is quite easy:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
page <- read_html("https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_de_ch%C3%A2teaux_luxembourgeois")

castles <- page %>%
    html_node(".wikitable") %>%
    html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
    select(Nom, Localité) %>%
    mutate(query = paste0(Nom, ", ", Localité))
```

I also add a `query` column which concatenates the name of the castle ("Nom") to where it is found
("Localité"). The query should be a better choice that simply the castle name to get the coordinates.

Now, I need to add the coordinates to this data frame. For this, I use a function I found online
that gets the coordinates from OpenStreetMap:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## geocoding function using OSM Nominatim API
## details: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim
## made by: D.Kisler

#https://datascienceplus.com/osm-nominatim-with-r-getting-locations-geo-coordinates-by-its-address/

nominatim_osm <- function(address = NULL){
    if(suppressWarnings(is.null(address)))
        return(data.frame())
    tryCatch(
        d <- jsonlite::fromJSON(
            gsub('\\@addr\\@', gsub('\\s+', '\\%20', address),
                 'http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search/@addr@?format=json&addressdetails=0&limit=1')
        ), error = function(c) return(data.frame())
    )
    if(length(d) == 0) return(data.frame())
    return(data.frame(lon = as.numeric(d$lon), lat = as.numeric(d$lat)))
}
```

I can now easily add the coordinates by mapping the `nominatim_osm()` function to the 
`query` column I built before:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
castles_osm <- castles %>%
    mutate(geolocation = map(query, nominatim_osm))
```

Let's take a look at `castles_osm`:

```{r, include=FALSE}
castles_osm <- read_rds("castles_osm.rds")
```

```{r}
head(castles_osm)
```

I now clean the data. There were several mistakes or castles that were not found, which I added
manually. I did not notice these mistakes immediately, but when I computed the distances matrix I 
notices several inconsistencies; 0's in positions other than the diagonal, as well as NAs. So I went
back to the raw data and corrected what was wrong, this time by looking at Google Maps. Thankfully
there were not that many mistakes. Below the whole workflow:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Little helper function to clean the lon and lat columns
extract_numbers <- function(string){
    str_extract_all(string, "\\d+", simplify = TRUE) %>%
        paste0(collapse = ".")
}

castles <- castles_osm %>%
    mutate(geolocation = 
               ifelse(Nom == "Château de Wintrange", "6.3517223, 49.5021975", geolocation)) %>%
    mutate(geolocation = 
               ifelse(Nom == "Septfontaines, Rollingergrund", "6.1028634, 49.6257147", geolocation)) %>%
    mutate(geolocation = 
               ifelse(Nom == "Château de Septfontaines", "5.9617443, 49.7006292", geolocation)) %>%
    mutate(geolocation = 
               ifelse(Nom == "Château de Senningen", "6.2342581, 49.6464632", geolocation)) %>%
    mutate(geolocation = 
               ifelse(Nom == "Château de Schauwenburg", "6.0478341, 49.6110245", geolocation)) %>%
    mutate(geolocation = 
               ifelse(Nom == "Château de Schuttbourg", "5.8980951, 49.7878706", geolocation)) %>%
    mutate(geolocation = 
               ifelse(Nom == "Château de Meysembourg", "6.1864882, 49.7704348", geolocation)) %>%
    mutate(geolocation = 
               ifelse(Nom == "Château de Mamer", "6.0232432, 49.6262397", geolocation)) %>%
    mutate(geolocation = 
               ifelse(Nom == "Château de Born", "6.5125214, 49.7611168", geolocation)) %>%
    # Found chateau de Betzdorf in Germany, not Luxembourg:
    mutate(geolocation = ifelse(Nom == "Château Betzdorf", "6.330278, 49.694167", geolocation)) %>%
    # Found château de Clemency in France, not Luxembourg:
    mutate(geolocation = ifelse(Nom == "Château de Clemency", "5.874167, 49.598056", geolocation)) %>%
    separate(geolocation, into = c("lon", "lat"), sep = ",") %>%
    filter(!is.na(lat)) %>%
    mutate(lon = map(lon, extract_numbers)) %>%
    mutate(lat = map(lat, extract_numbers)) %>%
    # Château de Beaufort found is in southern France, not the one in lux
    # Château de Dudelange is wrong (same as Bettembourg)
    # Château de Pétange is wrong (same as Differdange)
    # Château d'Urspelt is wrong (same as Clervaux)
    # Château d'Hesperange is wrong (same as Palais Grand-Ducal)
    mutate(lon = ifelse(Nom == "Château de Beaufort", "6.2865176", lon),
           lat = ifelse(Nom == "Château de Beaufort", "49.8335306", lat)) %>%
    mutate(lon = ifelse(Nom == "Château Dudelange", "6.0578438", lon),
           lat = ifelse(Nom == "Château Dudelange", "49.4905049", lat)) %>%
    mutate(lon = ifelse(Nom == "Château de Pétange", "6.105703", lon),
           lat = ifelse(Nom == "Château de Pétange", "49.7704746", lat)) %>%
    mutate(lon = ifelse(Nom == "Château d' Urspelt", "6.043375", lon),
           lat = ifelse(Nom == "Château d' Urspelt", "50.075342", lat)) %>%
    mutate(lon = ifelse(Nom == "Château d'Hesperange", "6.1524302", lon),
           lat = ifelse(Nom == "Château d'Hesperange", "49.573071", lat)) %>%
    mutate(latlon = paste0(lat, ",", lon)) %>%
    mutate(lon = as.numeric(lon), lat = as.numeric(lat))
```

In the end, I have `r nrow(castles)` castles, 2 of them were not found neither by OpenStreetMap nor
Google Maps.

Now I can get the distances matrix. For this, I opened an account at [Graphhopper](https://www.graphhopper.com/)
and used their [Matrix API](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/matrix/#matrix-api). When you open
a free account, you get a standard account for free for two weeks, which was perfect for this little
exercise. 

To use the Matrix API you can make a call with curl from your terminal, like this:

```
curl "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix?point=49.932707,11.588051&point=50.241935,10.747375&point=50.118817,11.983337&type=json&vehicle=car&debug=true&out_array=weights&out_array=times&out_array=distances&key=[YOUR_KEY]"
```

To use this from R, I use the `{curl}` package and the `curl_download()` function to download and
write the output to disk.

```{r, include=FALSE}
castles_dist <- fromJSON("distances_graphhopper.json")
```

I built the url like this. First, the "points" part:

```{r}
points <- paste(castles$latlon, collapse = "&point=")
```

<details>
  <summary>Click if you want to see the "points" string</summary>
```{r}
points
```
</details>

Then, I added my key, and pasted these elements together to form the correct url:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_key <- "my_key_was_here"

url <- paste0("https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix?point=", points, "&type=json&vehicle=car&debug=true&out_array=weights&out_array=times&out_array=distances&key=", my_key)
```

Then, I get the matrix like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
castles_dist <- "distances_graphhopper.json"
curl_download(url, castles_dist)
```

Let's take a look at the object:

```{r}
distances <- castles_dist$distances
```

<details>
  <summary>Click if you want to see the distance object</summary>
```{r}
distances
```
</details>

`distances` is a list where the first element is the distances from the first castle to all the others.
Let's make it a matrix:

```{r}
distances_matrix <- distances %>%
    reduce(rbind)
```

<details>
  <summary>Click if you want to see the distance matrix</summary>
```{r}
distances_matrix
```
</details>

Let's baptize the rows and columns:

```{r}
colnames(distances_matrix) <- castles$Nom

rownames(distances_matrix) <- castles$Nom
```

Now that we have the data, we can solve the TSP.

## Solving the Travelling salesman problem (that's the combinatorial optimization part)

Let's first coerce the `distances_matrix` to an `ATSP` object, which is needed for the solver.
`ATSP` stands for asymmetrical TSP. Asymmetrical because the `distances_matrix` is not symmetric, 
meaning that going from Castle A to Castle B is longer than going from Castle B to Castle A (for
example).

```{r}
atsp_castles <- ATSP(distances_matrix)
```

I then define a list of all the available methods:

```{r}
methods <- c("identity", "random", "nearest_insertion",
             "cheapest_insertion", "farthest_insertion", "arbitrary_insertion",
             "nn", "repetitive_nn", "two_opt")
```

And solve the problem with all the methods:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
solutions <- map(methods, ~solve_TSP(x = atsp_castles, method = ., two_opt = TRUE, rep = 10,  two_opt_repetitions = 10)) %>%
    set_names(methods)
```

I do this because the results vary depending on the methods, and I want to be exhaustive (solving 
this problem is quite fast, so there's no reason not to do it):

```{r}
solutions_df <- solutions %>%
    map_df(as.numeric)
```

`solutions_df` is a data frame with the order of the castles to visit in rows and the method used
in columns.

<details>
  <summary>Click if you want to see the solutions</summary>
```{r}
solutions_df
```
</details>

Now, let's extract the tour lengths, see which one is the minimum, then plot it.

```{r}
tour_lengths <- solutions %>%
    map_dbl(tour_length)

which.min(tour_lengths)
```

The total length of the tour is `r round(min(tour_lengths)/1000)` kilometers
(that's `r round((min(tour_lengths)/1000)/1.609344)` miles). Before plotting the data, let's
re-order it according to the solution:

```{r}
castles_to_visit <- castles[pull(solutions_df, names(which.min(tour_lengths))), ]
```

## Plot the solution

To plot the solution, I first use a data frame I created with the longitude and latitude of 
Luxembourguish communes, from the `geojson` file available on the 
[OpenData Portal](https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/limites-administratives-du-grand-duche-de-luxembourg/#resource-39af91a6-9ce4-4c18-8271-313b3ad7c7f5).
I converted it to a data frame because it is easier to manipulate this way. The code to do that is
in the appendix of this blog post:

```{r}
communes_df <- read_csv("communes_df.csv")
```

Now I can use `{ggplot2}` to create the map with the tour. I use `geom_polygon()` to build the map,
`geom_point()` to add the castles, `geom_path()` to connect the points according to the solution I
found and `geom_point()` again to highlight the starting castle:

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
ggplot() +
    geom_polygon(data = communes_df, aes(x = lon, y = lat, group = commune), colour = "grey", fill = NA) +
    geom_point(data = castles, aes(x = lon, y = lat), colour = "#82518c", size = 3) +
    geom_path(data = castles_to_visit, aes(x = lon, y = lat), colour = "#647e0e") +
    geom_point(data = (slice(castles_to_visit, 1)), aes(x = lon, y = lat), colour = "white", size = 5) +
    theme_void() +
    ggtitle("The shortest tour to visit 48 Luxembourguish castles") +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.title = element_blank(),
          legend.text = element_text(colour = "white"),
          plot.background = element_rect("#272b30"),
          plot.title = element_text(colour = "white")) 
```

The white point is the starting point of the tour. As a bonus, let's do the same plot without 
points, but castles emojis instead (using the `{ggimage}` package):

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
ggplot() +
    geom_polygon(data = communes_df, aes(x = lon, y = lat, group = commune), colour = "grey", fill = NA) +
    geom_emoji(data = castles, aes(x = lon, y = lat, image = "1f3f0")) + # <- this is the hex code for the "european castle" emoji
    geom_path(data = castles_to_visit, aes(x = lon, y = lat), colour = "#647e0e") +
    theme_void() +
    ggtitle("The shortest tour to visit 48 Luxembourguish castles") +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.title = element_blank(),
          legend.text = element_text(colour = "white"),
          plot.background = element_rect("#272b30"),
          plot.title = element_text(colour = "white"))
```

It's horrible.

## Appendix

The code below converts the `geojson` that can be downloaded from the 
[OpenData Portal](https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/limites-administratives-du-grand-duche-de-luxembourg/#resource-39af91a6-9ce4-4c18-8271-313b3ad7c7f5)
to `csv`. A `csv` file is easier to handle. I only focus on the communes.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
limadmin <- RJSONIO::fromJSON("limadmin.geojson")

communes <- limadmin$communes

extract_communes <- function(features){

    res <- features$geometry$coordinates %>%
        map(lift(rbind)) %>%
        as.data.frame() %>%
        rename(lon = X1,
               lat = X2)

    res %>%
        mutate(commune = features$properties[1])
}

communes_df <- map(limadmin$communes$features, extract_communes)

## Steinfort and Waldbredimus special treatment:

steinfort <- limadmin$communes$features[[5]]$geometry$coordinates[[1]] %>%
    map(lift(rbind)) %>%
    as.data.frame() %>%
    rename(lon = X1,
           lat = X2) %>%
    mutate(commune = "Steinfort")

waldbredimus <- limadmin$communes$features[[44]]$geometry$coordinates[[1]] %>%
    map(lift(rbind)) %>%
    as.data.frame() %>%
    rename(lon = X1,
           lat = X2) %>%
    mutate(commune = "Waldbredimus")

communes_df[[5]] <- NULL
communes_df[[43]] <- NULL


communes_df <- bind_rows(communes_df, list(steinfort, waldbredimus))
```
