This blog post is an excerpt of my ebook *Modern R with the tidyverse* that you can read for 
free [here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/). This is taken from Chapter 5, which presents
the `{tidyverse}` packages and how to use them to compute descriptive statistics and manipulate data.
In the text below, I scrape a table from Wikipedia, which shows when African countries gained 
independence from other countries. Then, using `{lubridate}` functions I show you how you can 
answers questions such as *Which countries gained independence before 1960?*.

## Set-up: scraping some data from Wikipedia

`{lubridate}` is yet another tidyverse package, that makes dealing with dates or duration data 
(and intervals) as painless as possible. I do not use every function contained in the package 
daily, and as such will only focus on some of the functions. However, if you have to deal with 
dates often, you might want to explore the package thoroughly.

Let's get some data from a Wikipedia table:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
page <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation_of_Africa")

independence <- page %>%
    html_node(".wikitable") %>%
    html_table(fill = TRUE)

independence <- independence %>%
    select(-Rank) %>%
    map_df(~str_remove_all(., "\\[.*\\]")) %>%
    rename(country = `Country[a]`,
           colonial_name = `Colonial name`,
           colonial_power = `Colonial power[b]`,
           independence_date = `Independence date[c]`,
           first_head_of_state = `First head of state[d]`,
           independence_won_through = `Independence won through`)
```

This dataset was scraped from the following Wikipedia [table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation_of_Africa#Timeline).
It shows when African countries gained independence from which colonial powers. In Chapter 11, I
will show you how to scrape Wikipedia pages using R. For now, let's take a look at the contents
of the dataset:

```{r}
independence
```

as you can see, the date of independence is in a format that might make it difficult to answer questions
such as *Which African countries gained independence before 1960 ?* for two reasons. First of all,
the date uses the name of the month instead of the number of the month (well, this is not such a 
big deal, but still), and second of all the type of
the independence day column is *character* and not "date". So our first task is to correctly define the column
as being of type date, while making sure that R understands that *January* is supposed to be "01", and so
on. There are several helpful functions included in `{lubridate}` to convert columns to dates. For instance
if the column you want to convert is of the form "2012-11-21", then you would use the function `ymd()`,
for "year-month-day". If, however the column is "2012-21-11", then you would use `ydm()`. There's
a few of these helper functions, and they can handle a lot of different formats for dates. In our case,
having the name of the month instead of the number might seem quite problematic, but it turns out
that this is a case that `{lubridate}` handles painfully:

```{r}
library(lubridate)

independence <- independence %>%
  mutate(independence_date = dmy(independence_date))
```

Some dates failed to parse, for instance for Morocco. This is because these countries have several
independence dates; this means that the string to convert looks like:

```
"2 March 1956
7 April 1956
10 April 1958
4 January 1969"
```

which obviously cannot be converted by `{lubridate}` without further manipulation. I ignore these cases for
simplicity's sake.

Let's take a look at the data now:

```{r}
independence
```

As you can see, we now have a date column in the right format. We can now answer questions such as
*Which countries gained independence before 1960?* quite easily, by using the functions `year()`,
`month()` and `day()`. Let's see which countries gained independence before 1960:

```{r}
independence %>%
  filter(year(independence_date) <= 1960) %>%
  pull(country)
```

You guessed it, `year()` extracts the year of the date column and converts it as a *numeric* so that we can work
on it. This is the same for `month()` or `day()`. Let's try to see if countries gained their independence on
Christmas Eve:

```{r}
independence %>%
  filter(month(independence_date) == 12,
         day(independence_date) == 24) %>%
  pull(country)
```

Seems like Libya was the only one! You can also operate on dates. For instance, let's compute the difference between
two dates, using the `interval()` column:

```{r}
independence %>%
  mutate(today = lubridate::today()) %>%
  mutate(independent_since = interval(independence_date, today)) %>%
  select(country, independent_since)
```

The `independent_since` column now contains an *interval* object that we can convert to years:

```{r}
independence %>%
  mutate(today = lubridate::today()) %>%
  mutate(independent_since = interval(independence_date, today)) %>%
  select(country, independent_since) %>%
  mutate(years_independent = as.numeric(independent_since, "years"))
```

We can now see for how long the last country to gain independence has been independent.
Because the data is not tidy (in some cases, an African country was colonized by two powers,
see Libya), I will only focus on 4 European colonial powers: Belgium, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom:

```{r}
independence %>%
  filter(colonial_power %in% c("Belgium", "France", "Portugal", "United Kingdom")) %>%
  mutate(today = lubridate::today()) %>%
  mutate(independent_since = interval(independence_date, today)) %>%
  mutate(years_independent = as.numeric(independent_since, "years")) %>%
  group_by(colonial_power) %>%
  summarise(last_colony_independent_for = min(years_independent, na.rm = TRUE))
```

`{lubridate}` contains many more functions. If you often work with dates, duration or interval data, `{lubridate}`
is a package that you have to master.
