My name is Bruno Rodrigues and hold a PhD in Economics from the 
[University of Strasbourg](http://www.unistra.fr).

I started working at [STATEC](http://www.statistiques.public.lu/en/index.html), which is the national
statistical office of the [Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg) in
July 2016 until June 2018. I was part of the 
[research division](http://www.statistiques.public.lu/en/actors/statec/organisation/red/)
and my main mission was assisting the researchers with data issues.

I am now a Senior Advisor at 
[PwC Luxembourg in the data and analytics department](https://www.pwc.lu/en/digital-services/analytics.html).

I mostly help our clients with Data Science-related challenges that they may face.

My hobbies are boxing, lifting weights, cycling, cooking and reading.
I try doing this things while listening to [FIP](http://www.fipradio.fr/player) or [Nightwave Plaza](https://plaza.one/).
I also enjoy learning about the R programming language and sharing my knowledge.
That's why I made this blog and why I am currently writing a book about functional programming, unit
testing and package development with R. You can read it for free [here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/) and
you can buy a digital copy at [leanpub](http://www.leanpub.com/fput).

I'm currently writing another one, that you can read [here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/).
