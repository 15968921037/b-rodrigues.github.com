My name is Bruno Rodrigues and I am a PhD candidate at the [Bureau d’économie Théorique et Appliquée](http://www.beta-umr7522.fr/?lang=fr) at the [University of Strasbourg](http://www.unistra.fr).
My thesis advisor is Bertrand Kœbel and my co-advisor is François Laisney.

I started working at [STATEC](http://www.statistiques.public.lu/en/index.html), which is the national
statistical office of the [Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg) in
July 2016. I'm part of the [research division](http://www.statistiques.public.lu/en/actors/statec/organisation/red/)
and my main mission is assisting the researchers with data issues.

My hobbies are boxing, lifting weights, cycling, cooking and reading.
I try doing this things while listening to [FIP](http://www.fipradio.fr/player) [Nightwave Plaza](https://plaza.one/).
I also enjoy learning about the R programming language and sharing my knowledge.
That's why I made this blog and why I am currently writing a book about functional programming, unit
testing and package development with R. You can read it for free [here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/) and
you can buy a digital copy at [leanpub](http://www.leanpub.com/fput).
